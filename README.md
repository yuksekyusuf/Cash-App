# Cash-App
Cash-App is a small take home project showing stock exchange prices for certain companies. Despite the fact that the app has small feature, I try to showcase best practices in the architectural design and testing.

## Tech/Frameworks used
- Swift
- UIKit (100% Programmatic UI)
- Diffable Datasource
- I used a pragmatic approach in my architectural design, a combination of MVVM and VIPER, inspired by <a href="https://omerfarukgul.medium.com/a-pragmatic-approach-to-mobile-architecture-f5e12175aacf" target="_blank">this article</a>
